    question: "What's your design process like?",
    answer: "My process follows three core phases: Discovery, Design, and Delivery. In the Discovery phase, I learn everything about your business, goals, and target audience.

Finally, the Delivery phase includes development, testing, and launch, followed by continued support and optimization."
